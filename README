Foursquare+OAuth Source and Example for iPhone
Created by Andrew Vergara

If you use it, please include the following text somewhere in your application's user-facing text:
"Includes Foursquare+OAuth code by Andrew Vergara"

The goal of this is to create a drop-in code package for iPhone apps that want to access Foursquare APIv2 via OAuth. 

This project is heavily influenced by Ben Gottlieb's Twitter-OAuth-iPhone(https://github.com/bengottlieb/Twitter-OAuth-iPhone). 
Hopefully, I wrote it well enough that it is easily digestible.


Enjoy, and please let me know if you have any feedback!

12-08-10: Since this is currently for prototypical purposes most of the actions are written in the viewcontroller.  Eventually, I will abstract these out.
